  # Create a bundle by uploading an archive
  # Create a new deployment bundle by uploading an archive.  Upload a compressed &#x60;tar&#x60; archive containing code/data that represent one deployment of this content. Bundles must be &#x60;gzip&#x60; compressed &#x60;tar&#x60; archives.  * All deployment bundles include a &#x60;manifest.json&#x60; describing the contained files and their runtime dependencies. * A bundle for a Shiny application includes an &#x60;app.R&#x60; or &#x60;ui.R&#x60; and &#x60;server.R&#x60;, and any images or data files required by the application. * Python API and application bundles include the application source code, typically named &#x60;app.py&#x60;, and a list of required package dependencies in &#x60;requirements.txt&#x60;. * An R Markdown document bundle includes the &#x60;index.Rmd&#x60; file along with any R scripts and data files needed to render the report. * A Quarto bundle includes at least one &#x60;.qmd&#x60; file, along with any auxiliary files required. Quarto projects include a &#x60;_quarto.yml&#x60; file. * Bundles containing HTML content should include any CSS, Javascript, and images required by that document.  The &#x60;manifest.json&#x60; file and primary source files like &#x60;app.R&#x60;, &#x60;app.py&#x60;, or &#x60;index.Rmd&#x60; must be in the top level of the archived directory. Subdirectories may be used for secondary data and scripts.  Here is how you might use &#x60;tar&#x60; to create an archive for a Shiny application. It includes the manifest, the application, and an image.  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash tar zcf bundle.tar.gz ./manifest.json ./app.R ./www/logo.png &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  You could create a bundle for a Python application similarly:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash tar zcf bundle.tar.gz ./manifest.json ./app.py ./requirements.txt ./www/logo.png &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Here is another example of creating a bundle for an application but from its parent directory. The application is in a &#x60;sales-analyzer&#x60; sub-directory. This command will include all files in the subdirectory; check to ensure that this does not include extraneous files such as output files or local Python environments that you do not want in the bundle.  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;bash tar zcf bundle.tar.gz ./sales-analyzer &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Publishers with collaborator rights to this content (including the owner) are permitted to upload deployment bundles. Users without these rights are rejected.  Administrators must be a collaborator for a content item before they receive upload rights.
  # @param guid character The unique identifier of the desired content item.
  # @param archive data.frame A `gzip` compressed `tar` archive file.
  # @param x_content_checksum character The Base64-encoded MD5 sum of the archive file. (optional)
  # @return [Bundle]
