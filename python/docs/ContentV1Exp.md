## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**guid** | **str** | The unique identifier of this content item. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | A simple, URL-friendly identifier. Allows alpha-numeric characters, hyphens (&#x60;\&quot;-\&quot;&#x60;), and underscores (&#x60;\&quot;_\&quot;&#x60;). | [optional] [default to '']
**title** | **str** | The title of this content. | [optional] [default to 'null']
**description** | **str** | A rich description of this content. | [optional] [default to '']
**access_type** | **str** | Access type describes how this content manages its viewers. The value &#x60;all&#x60; is the most permissive; any visitor to Posit Connect will be able to view this content. The value &#x60;logged_in&#x60; indicates that all Posit Connect accounts may view the content. The &#x60;acl&#x60; value lets specifically enumerated users and groups view the content. Users configured as collaborators may always view content. | [optional] [default to 'acl']
**connection_timeout** | **int** | Maximum number of seconds allowed without data sent or received across a client connection. A value of &#x60;0&#x60; means connections will never time-out (not recommended). When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.ConnectionTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**read_timeout** | **int** | Maximum number of seconds allowed without data received from a client connection. A value of &#x60;0&#x60; means a lack of client (browser) interaction never causes the connection to close. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.ReadTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**init_timeout** | **int** | The maximum number of seconds allowed for an interactive application to start. Posit Connect must be able to connect to a newly launched Shiny application, for example, before this threshold has elapsed. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.InitTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**idle_timeout** | **int** | The maximum number of seconds a worker process for an interactive application to remain alive after it goes idle (no active connections). When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.IdleTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**max_processes** | **int** | Specifies the total number of concurrent processes allowed for a single interactive application. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MaxProcesses&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**min_processes** | **int** | Specifies the minimum number of concurrent processes allowed for a single interactive application. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MinProcesses&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**max_conns_per_process** | **int** | Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed to an individual process. Incoming connections which will exceed this limit are routed to a new process or rejected. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MaxConnsPerProcess&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**load_factor** | **float** | Controls how aggressively new processes are spawned. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.LoadFactor&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional]

The &#x60;content_category&#x60; field refines the type of content specified by &#x60;app_mode&#x60;. It is empty by default. The rsconnect R package may assign a value when analyzing your content and building its manifest and bundle. Plots (images created in the RStudio IDE and presented in the \&quot;Plots\&quot; pane) have an &#x60;app_mode&#x60; of &#x60;static&#x60; and receive a &#x60;content_category&#x60; of &#x60;plot&#x60; to distinguish them from other HTML documents. Pinned static data sets have an &#x60;app_mode&#x60; of &#x60;static&#x60; and a &#x60;content_category&#x60; of &#x60;pin&#x60;. Multi-document R Markdown sites have an &#x60;app_mode&#x60; of &#x60;rmd-static&#x60; and a &#x60;content_category&#x60; of &#x60;site&#x60;. | [optional]

Automatically assigned upon the successful deployment of a bundle. | [optional] 
**py_version** | **str** | The version of the Python interpreter associated with this content. The value &#x60;null&#x60; represents that a Python interpreter is not used by this content or that the client does not have sufficient rights to see this information or that the Python package environment has not been successfully restored. Automatically assigned upon the successful deployment of a bundle. | [optional] 
**quarto_version** | **str** | The version of Quarto associated with this content.

**run_as_current_user** | **bool** | Indicates that Connect should run processes for this content item under the Unix account of the user who visits it. Content accessed anonymously will continue to run as the specified &#x60;run_as&#x60; user.  Connect must be configured to use PAM authentication with the server settings &#x60;Applications.RunAsCurrentUser &#x3D; true&#x60; and &#x60;PAM.ForwardPassword &#x3D; true&#x60;. This setting has no effect for other authentication types.  This setting only applies to application content types (Shiny, Dash, Streamlit, and Bokeh). | [optional] [default to False]
**owner_guid** | **str** | The unique identifier of the user who created this content item. Automatically assigned when the content is created. | [optional] 
**url** | **str** | The URL associated with this content. Computed from the associated vanity URL or the identifiers for this content. | [optional] 
**role** | **str** | The relationship of the accessing user to this content. A value of &#x60;owner&#x60; is returned for the content owner. &#x60;editor&#x60; indicates a collaborator.
