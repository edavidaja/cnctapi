# connectapi2::ContentV1Exp

The content object models all the \"things\" you may deploy to Posit Connect. This includes Shiny applications, R Markdown documents, Quarto documents and sites, Jupyter Notebooks, Plumber APIs, FastAPI and Flask APIs, Python apps, plots, and pins.  The `app_mode` field specifies the type of content represented by this item and defines its runtime model.  * Active content, such as apps and APIs, executes on demand as requests arrive. * Reports render from source to output HTML. This rendering can occur based on a schedule or when explicitly triggered. It is *not* on each visit. Viewers of this type of content see a previously rendered result. * Static content is presented to viewers in its deployed form.  The fields `bundle_id`, `app_mode`, `content_category`, `has_parameters`,  `cluster_name`, `image_name`, `r_version`, `py_version`, and `quarto_version` are computed as a consequence of a <a href=\"#post-/v1/experimental/content/-guid-/deploy\">POST /v1/experimental/content/{guid}/deploy</a> deployment operation.  The `run_as` and `run_as_current_user` fields are read-only as fields of Content objects. A future API will allow adjustment of these properties. Use the Posit Connect dashboard to adjust what Unix user executes your content.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**guid** | **character** | The unique identifier of this content item. | [optional] [readonly] 
**name** | **character** | A simple, URL-friendly identifier. Allows alpha-numeric characters, hyphens (&#x60;\&quot;-\&quot;&#x60;), and underscores (&#x60;\&quot;_\&quot;&#x60;). | [optional] [default to &quot;&quot;] 
**title** | **character** | The title of this content. | [optional] [default to &quot;null&quot;] 
**description** | **character** | A rich description of this content. | [optional] [default to &quot;&quot;] 
**access_type** | **character** | Access type describes how this content manages its viewers. The value &#x60;all&#x60; is the most permissive; any visitor to Posit Connect will be able to view this content. The value &#x60;logged_in&#x60; indicates that all Posit Connect accounts may view the content. The &#x60;acl&#x60; value lets specifically enumerated users and groups view the content. Users configured as collaborators may always view content. | [optional] [default to &quot;acl&quot;] [Enum: [all, logged_in, acl]] 
**connection_timeout** | **integer** | Maximum number of seconds allowed without data sent or received across a client connection. A value of &#x60;0&#x60; means connections will never time-out (not recommended). When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.ConnectionTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**read_timeout** | **integer** | Maximum number of seconds allowed without data received from a client connection. A value of &#x60;0&#x60; means a lack of client (browser) interaction never causes the connection to close. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.ReadTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**init_timeout** | **integer** | The maximum number of seconds allowed for an interactive application to start. Posit Connect must be able to connect to a newly launched Shiny application, for example, before this threshold has elapsed. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.InitTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**idle_timeout** | **integer** | The maximum number of seconds a worker process for an interactive application to remain alive after it goes idle (no active connections). When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.IdleTimeout&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**max_processes** | **integer** | Specifies the total number of concurrent processes allowed for a single interactive application. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MaxProcesses&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**min_processes** | **integer** | Specifies the minimum number of concurrent processes allowed for a single interactive application. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MinProcesses&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**max_conns_per_process** | **integer** | Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed to an individual process. Incoming connections which will exceed this limit are routed to a new process or rejected. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.MaxConnsPerProcess&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional] 
**load_factor** | **numeric** | Controls how aggressively new processes are spawned. When &#x60;null&#x60;, the default &#x60;Scheduler.LoadFactor&#x60; is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand. | [optional]
