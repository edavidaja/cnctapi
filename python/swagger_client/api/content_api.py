    Posit Connect API Reference

    The Posit Connect Server API can be used to perform certain user actions remotely. You will need to install a tool or library that can make HTTP requests, such as: - [httr](http://httr.r-lib.org/) (R HTTP library) - [curl](https://curl.se/) (Linux tool for making HTTP calls) - [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (Python HTTP library)  Please note that all API paths are relative to the base API URL (e.g., <code>http:/localhost:3939/\\_\\_api\\_\\_</code>). Unless otherwise noted, all endpoints which accept a request body will require the body to be in JSON format. Similarly, all response bodies will be returned in JSON format.  <a id=\"download\"></a> ## Specifications  The Posit Connect Server API Swagger specification is available for download as either JSON or YAML. Both formats contain the same information, also presented on this page.  * <a href=\"swagger.json\" title=\"Swagger (JSON)\" target=\"_blank\">Swagger (JSON)</a> * <a href=\"swagger.yaml\" title=\"Swagger (YAML)\" target=\"_blank\">Swagger (YAML)</a>  <a id=\"versioning-policy\"></a> ## Versioning of the API  The Posit Connect Server API uses a simple, single number versioning scheme as noted as the first part of each endpoint path.  This version number will only be incremented in the event that non-backward compatible changes are made to an existing endpoint. Note that this occurs on a per-endpoint basis; see the section on [deprecation](#deprecation) below for more information.  Changes that are considered backward compatible are:  * New fields in responses. * New non-required fields in requests. * New endpoint behavior which does not violate the current functional intent of the   endpoint.  Changes that are considered non-backward compatible are:  * Removal or rename of request or response fields. * A change of the type or format of one or more request or response fields. * Addition of new required request fields. * A substantial deviation from the current functional intent of the endpoint.  The points relating to functional intent are assumed to be extremely rare as more often such situations will result in a completely new endpoint, which makes the change a backward compatible addition.  ### Experimentation  Posit Connect labels experimental endpoints in the API by including `/experimental` in the endpoint path immediately after the version indicator.  If an endpoint is noted as experimental, it should not be relied upon for any production work.  These are endpoints that Posit Connect is making available to our customers to solicit feedback; they are subject to change without notice.  Such changes include anything from altered request/response shapes, to complete abandonment of the endpoint.  This public review of an experimental endpoint will last as long as necessary to either prove its viability or to determine that it’s not really needed.  The time for this will vary based on the intricacies of each endpoint.  When the endpoint is finalized, the next release of Posit Connect will mark the experimental path as deprecated while adding the endpoint without the `/experimental` prefix. The path with the experimental prefix will be removed six months later.  The documentation for the endpoint will also note, during that time, the original, experimental, path.  All experimental endpoints are clearly marked as such in this documentation.  <a id=\"deprecation\"></a> ### Deprecation and Removal of Old Versions  It is possible that Posit Connect may decide to deprecate an endpoint.  This will happen if either the endpoint serves no useful purpose because it’s functionality is now handled by a different endpoint or because there is a newer version of the endpoint that should be used.  If a deprecated endpoint is called, the response to it will include an extra HTTP header called, `X-Deprecated-Endpoint` and will have as a value the path of the endpoint that should be used instead.  If the functionality has no direct replacement, the value will be set to `n/a`.  Deprecated versions of an endpoint will be supported for 1 year from the release date of Posit Connect in which the endpoint was marked as deprecated.  At that time, the endpoint is subject to removal at the discretion of Posit Connect.  The life cycle of an endpoint will follow these steps.  1. The `/v1/endpoint` is public and in use by Posit Connect customers. 1. Posit Connect makes `/v2/experimental/endpoint` available for testing and feedback.    Customers should still use `/v1/endpoint` for production work. 1. Posit Connect moves version 2 of the endpoint out of experimentation so, all within    the same release:     1. `/v1/endpoint` is marked as deprecated.     1. `/v2/experimental/endpoint` is marked as deprecated.     1. `/v2/endpoint` is made public. 1. Six months later, `/v2/experimental/endpoint` is removed from the product. 1. Twelve months later, `/v1/endpoint` is removed from the product.  Note that it is possible that Posit Connect may produce a new version of an existing endpoint without making an experimental version of it first.  The same life cycle, without those parts, will still be followed.  <a id=\"authentication\"> </a> ## Authentication  Most endpoints require you to identify yourself as a valid Posit Connect user. You do this by specifying an API Key when you make a call to the server. The [API Keys](../user/api-keys/) chapter of the Posit Connect User Guide explains how to create an API Key.  <a id=\"api-keys\"></a> ### API Keys  API Keys are managed by each user in the Posit Connect dashboard. If you ever lose an API Key or otherwise feel it has been compromised, use the dashboard to revoke the key and create another one.  **WARNING**: Keep your API Key safe.  If your Posit Connect server's URL does not begin with `https`, your API Key could be intercepted and used by a malicious actor.  Once you have an API Key, you can authenticate by passing the key with a prefix of `\"Key \"` (the space is important) in the Authorization header.  Below are examples of invoking the \"Get R Information\" endpoint.  **cURL** ```bash curl -H \"Authorization: Key XXXXXXXXXXX\" \\      https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r ```  **R** ```r library(httr) apiKey <- \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" result <- GET(\"https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r\",   add_headers(Authorization = paste(\"Key\", apiKey))) ```  **Python** ```python import requests r = requests.get(   'https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r',   headers = { 'Authorization': 'Key XXXXXXXXXXX' } ) ```  <a id=\"api-cors-considerations\"></a> ## API CORS considerations  When accessing the Posit Connect API via a context that enforces CORS restrictions such as a browser, there are some configuration values that will likely need to be set.  Connect does not enable CORS headers and pre-flight requests by default; it must be enabled via the `CORS.Enabled` configuration option.  The CORS header values that are the same for all requests are  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is set to `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD` - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is set to `Origin, Content-Length, Content-Type` - `Access-Control-Max-Age` is set to 12 hours - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`  The remaining header value that may be configured is  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` which is set from the   `CORS.AllowOrigin` config value and is empty by   default, meaning only local origins and `Server.Address` are   allowed.  <a id=\"API-Error-Codes\"></a> ## API Error Codes  <table> <thead> <tr><th>Error&nbsp;Code</th><th>Message</th><th>HTTP status</th><th>HTTP message</th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>An internal failure occurred.</td><td>500</td><td>Internal Server Error</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>The requested method or endpoint is not supported.</td><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>The requested object ID is invalid.</td><td>400</td><td>Bad Request</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>The requested object does not exist.</td><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Application name must be between 3 and 64 alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.</td><td>400</td><td>Bad Request</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>The password is not strong enough.
