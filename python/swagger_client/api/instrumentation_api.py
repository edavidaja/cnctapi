    Posit Connect API Reference

    The Posit Connect Server API can be used to perform certain user actions remotely. You will need to install a tool or library that can make HTTP requests, such as: - [httr](http://httr.r-lib.org/) (R HTTP library) - [curl](https://curl.se/) (Linux tool for making HTTP calls) - [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (Python HTTP library)  Please note that all API paths are relative to the base API URL (e.g., <code>http:/localhost:3939/\\_\\_api\\_\\_</code>). Unless otherwise noted, all endpoints which accept a request body will require the body to be in JSON format. Similarly, all response bodies will be returned in JSON format.  <a id=\"download\"></a> ## Specifications  The Posit Connect Server API Swagger specification is available for download as either JSON or YAML. Both formats contain the same information, also presented on this page.  * <a href=\"swagger.json\" title=\"Swagger (JSON)\" target=\"_blank\">Swagger (JSON)</a> * <a href=\"swagger.yaml\" title=\"Swagger (YAML)\" target=\"_blank\">Swagger (YAML)</a>  <a id=\"versioning-policy\"></a> ## Versioning of the API  The Posit Connect Server API uses a simple, single number versioning scheme as noted as the first part of each endpoint path.  This version number will only be incremented in the event that non-backward compatible changes are made to an existing endpoint. Note that this occurs on a per-endpoint basis; see the section on [deprecation](#deprecation) below for more information.  Changes that are considered backward compatible are:  * New fields in responses. * New non-required fields in requests. * New endpoint behavior which does not violate the current functional intent of the   endpoint.  Changes that are considered non-backward compatible are:  * Removal or rename of request or response fields. * A change of the type or format of one or more request or response fields. * Addition of new required request fields. * A substantial deviation from the current functional intent of the endpoint.  The points relating to functional intent are assumed to be extremely rare as more often such situations will result in a completely new endpoint, which makes the change a backward compatible addition.  ### Experimentation  Posit Connect labels experimental endpoints in the API by including `/experimental` in the endpoint path immediately after the version indicator.  If an endpoint is noted as experimental, it should not be relied upon for any production work.  These are endpoints that Posit Connect is making available to our customers to solicit feedback; they are subject to change without notice.  Such changes include anything from altered request/response shapes, to complete abandonment of the endpoint.  This public review of an experimental endpoint will last as long as necessary to either prove its viability or to determine that it’s not really needed.  The time for this will vary based on the intricacies of each endpoint.  When the endpoint is finalized, the next release of Posit Connect will mark the experimental path as deprecated while adding the endpoint without the `/experimental` prefix. The path with the experimental prefix will be removed six months later.  The documentation for the endpoint will also note, during that time, the original, experimental, path.  All experimental endpoints are clearly marked as such in this documentation.  <a id=\"deprecation\"></a> ### Deprecation and Removal of Old Versions  It is possible that Posit Connect may decide to deprecate an endpoint.  This will happen if either the endpoint serves no useful purpose because it’s functionality is now handled by a different endpoint or because there is a newer version of the endpoint that should be used.  If a deprecated endpoint is called, the response to it will include an extra HTTP header called, `X-Deprecated-Endpoint` and will have as a value the path of the endpoint that should be used instead.  If the functionality has no direct replacement, the value will be set to `n/a`.  Deprecated versions of an endpoint will be supported for 1 year from the release date of Posit Connect in which the endpoint was marked as deprecated.  At that time, the endpoint is subject to removal at the discretion of Posit Connect.  The life cycle of an endpoint will follow these steps.  1. The `/v1/endpoint` is public and in use by Posit Connect customers. 1. Posit Connect makes `/v2/experimental/endpoint` available for testing and feedback.    Customers should still use `/v1/endpoint` for production work. 1. Posit Connect moves version 2 of the endpoint out of experimentation so, all within    the same release:     1. `/v1/endpoint` is marked as deprecated.     1. `/v2/experimental/endpoint` is marked as deprecated.     1. `/v2/endpoint` is made public. 1. Six months later, `/v2/experimental/endpoint` is removed from the product. 1. Twelve months later, `/v1/endpoint` is removed from the product.  Note that it is possible that Posit Connect may produce a new version of an existing endpoint without making an experimental version of it first.  The same life cycle, without those parts, will still be followed.  <a id=\"authentication\"> </a> ## Authentication  Most endpoints require you to identify yourself as a valid Posit Connect user. You do this by specifying an API Key when you make a call to the server. The [API Keys](../user/api-keys/) chapter of the Posit Connect User Guide explains how to create an API Key.  <a id=\"api-keys\"></a> ### API Keys  API Keys are managed by each user in the Posit Connect dashboard. If you ever lose an API Key or otherwise feel it has been compromised, use the dashboard to revoke the key and create another one.  **WARNING**: Keep your API Key safe.  If your Posit Connect server's URL does not begin with `https`, your API Key could be intercepted and used by a malicious actor.  Once you have an API Key, you can authenticate by passing the key with a prefix of `\"Key \"` (the space is important) in the Authorization header.  Below are examples of invoking the \"Get R Information\" endpoint.  **cURL** ```bash curl -H \"Authorization: Key XXXXXXXXXXX\" \\      https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r ```  **R** ```r library(httr) apiKey <- \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" result <- GET(\"https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r\",   add_headers(Authorization = paste(\"Key\", apiKey))) ```  **Python** ```python import requests r = requests.get(   'https://positconnect.example.com/__api__/v1/server_settings/r',   headers = { 'Authorization': 'Key XXXXXXXXXXX' } ) ```  <a id=\"api-cors-considerations\"></a> ## API CORS considerations  When accessing the Posit Connect API via a context that enforces CORS restrictions such as a browser, there are some configuration values that will likely need to be set.  Connect does not enable CORS headers and pre-flight requests by default; it must be enabled via the `CORS.Enabled` configuration option.  The CORS header values that are the same for all requests are  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is set to `GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD` - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is set to `Origin, Content-Length, Content-Type` - `Access-Control-Max-Age` is set to 12 hours - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`  The remaining header value that may be configured is  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` which is set from the   `CORS.AllowOrigin` config value and is empty by   default, meaning only local origins and `Server.Address` are   allowed.  <a id=\"API-Error-Codes\"></a> ## API Error Codes  <table> <thead> <tr><th>Error&nbsp;Code</th><th>Message</th><th>HTTP status</th><th>HTTP message</th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td>1</td><td>An internal failure occurred.</td><td>500</td><td>Internal Server Error</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>The requested method or endpoint is not supported.</td><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>The requested object ID is invalid.</td><td>400</td><td>Bad Request</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>The requested object does not exist.</td><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Application name must be between 3 and 64 alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.</td><td>400</td><td>Bad Request</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>The password is not strong enough.

        This endpoint returns a portion of the visit (or \"hits\") information for all content types _other than Shiny applications_. The results returned include paging details that can be used to navigate the information this endpoint returns.  The information returned is based on data collected by Posit Connect as users visit content.  #### Important Notes Prior to the release of this API, there was an issue with how visits were returned that caused extra entries to be stored under certain circumstances.  These will affect analyses that interpret visit counts.  Entries that were recorded before the issue was addressed are not returned by default.  If you desire these records, specify the `min_data_version` filter with a value of 0.  This endpoint requires administrator or publisher access.  #### Filtering of results:  There are several ways the result set can be filtered by the server before being sent back within the API response. If multiple filters are in effect, they will be logically ANDed together.  ##### Implicit Filtering If the user calling the endpoint is a publisher, the data returned will be limited to the content owned by the user.  ##### Time Windows  This API accepts optional `from` and `to` timestamps to define a window of interest.  If `from` is not specified, it is assumed to be before the earliest recorded information.  If `to` is not specified, it is assumed to be \"now\".  Any visit to content that falls inclusively within the time window will be part of the result set.  #### Responses  The response of a call will contain zero or more data records representing a visit by a user to a piece of content.  No more than `limit` records will be returned. Multiple requests of this endpoint are typically required to retrieve the complete result set from the server.  To facilitate this, each response includes a paging object containing full URL links which can be requested to iteratively move forward or backward through multiple response pages.  # noqa: E501

Example value = `6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3` using UUID [RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) format.  Multiple content GUIDs may be specified using the bar character `|` which represents a logical OR across the surounding GUIDs.  For example, `content_guid=6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3|e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9` will filter the result set to only the access records for the Shiny Applications with a GUID of `6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3` or a GUID of `e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9`.  - The GUID associated with a published Shiny application can be found on the   Info panel for the application within the Posit Connect Dashboard window. - Note that if you specify the `content_guid` more than once like this,   `content_guid=6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3&content_guid=&e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9`   you will receive results for the first GUID only; the 2nd and subsequent `content_guid`   fields are ignored. - Note that there is a practical limit of around 40 to the number of GUIDs that   may be specified due to the length of a html query string.
        :param int min_data_version: Filter by data version.  Records with a data version lower than the given value will be excluded from the set of results.  The [Shiny Application Events](../admin/historical-information/#shiny-application-events) section of the Posit Connect Admin Guide explains how to interpret `data_version` values.
        :param datetime _from: The timestamp that starts the time window of interest.  Any usage information that _ends_ prior to this timestamp will not be returned.  Individual records may contain a starting time that is before this if they end after it or have not finished.  Example value = `2018-09-15T18:00:00Z` using [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format of (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss` followed by either `-##:##`, `.##Z` or `Z`)
        :param datetime to: The timestamp that ends the time window of interest.  Any usage information that _starts_ after this timestamp will not be returned.  Individual records may contain an ending time that is after this (or no ending time) if they start before it.  Example value = `2018-09-15T18:00:00Z` using [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format of (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss` followed by either `-##:##`, `.##Z` or `Z`)
        :param int limit: The number of records to return.  The minimum supported value is 1 and maximum supported value is 500.  Note that `limit` is a \"best effort\" request since there may not be enough usage entries to satisfy the limit.
        :param str previous: Retrieve the previous page of Shiny application usage logs relative to the provided value.  This value corresponds to an internal reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate attribute within the paging object of a previous response.
        :param str next: Retrieve the next page of Shiny application usage logs relative to the provided value.  This value corresponds to an internal reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate attribute within the paging object of a previous response.
        :param bool asc_order: Determines if the response records should be listed in ascending or descending order within the response.  Ordering is by the `started` timestamp field.
        :return: ShinyAppUsageLogs
