  # Get Content Visits
  # This endpoint returns a portion of the visit (or \&quot;hits\&quot;) information for all content types _other than Shiny applications_. The results returned include paging details that can be used to navigate the information this endpoint returns.  The information returned is based on data collected by Posit Connect as users visit content.  #### Important Notes Prior to the release of this API, there was an issue with how visits were returned that caused extra entries to be stored under certain circumstances.  These will affect analyses that interpret visit counts.  Entries that were recorded before the issue was addressed are not returned by default.  If you desire these records, specify the &#x60;min_data_version&#x60; filter with a value of 0.  This endpoint requires administrator or publisher access.  #### Filtering of results:  There are several ways the result set can be filtered by the server before being sent back within the API response. If multiple filters are in effect, they will be logically ANDed together.  ##### Implicit Filtering If the user calling the endpoint is a publisher, the data returned will be limited to the content owned by the user.  ##### Time Windows  This API accepts optional &#x60;from&#x60; and &#x60;to&#x60; timestamps to define a window of interest.  If &#x60;from&#x60; is not specified, it is assumed to be before the earliest recorded information.  If &#x60;to&#x60; is not specified, it is assumed to be \&quot;now\&quot;.  Any visit to content that falls inclusively within the time window will be part of the result set.  #### Responses  The response of a call will contain zero or more data records representing a visit by a user to a piece of content.  No more than &#x60;limit&#x60; records will be returned. Multiple requests of this endpoint are typically required to retrieve the complete result set from the server.  To facilitate this, each response includes a paging object containing full URL links which can be requested to iteratively move forward or backward through multiple response pages.
  # @param content_guid character Filter results by content GUID.  This parameter will limit the results to include only the access records for content matching the content GUID filter value.  Example value = `6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3` using UUID [RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) format.  Multiple content GUIDs may be specified using the bar character `|` which represents a logical OR across the surounding GUIDs.  For example, `content_guid=6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3|e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9` will filter the result set to only the access records for content with a GUID of `6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3` or a GUID of `e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9`.  - The GUID associated with published content can be found on the Info panel for   the content within the Posit Connect Dashboard window. - Note that if you specify the `content_guid` more than once like this,   `content_guid=6f300623-1e0c-48e6-a473-ddf630c0c0c3&content_guid=&e08a86af-a262-4152-8366-f2d8ec3c54f9`   you will receive results for the first GUID only; the 2nd and subsequent `content_guid`   fields are ignored. - Note that there is a practical limit of around 40 to the number of GUIDs that   may be specified due to the length of a html query string. (optional)
  # @param min_data_version integer Filter by data version.  Records with a data version lower than the given value will be excluded from the set of results.  The [Content Visit Events](../admin/historical-information/#content-visit-events) section of the Posit Connect Admin Guide explains how to interpret `data_version` values. (optional)
  # @param from character The timestamp that starts the time window of interest.  Any visit information that happened prior to this timestamp will not be returned.  Example value = `2018-09-15T18:00:00Z` using [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format of (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss` followed by either `-##:##`, `.##Z` or `Z`) (optional)
  # @param to character The timestamp that ends the time window of interest.  Any visit information that happened after this timestamp will not be returned.  Example value = `2018-09-15T18:00:00Z` using [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format of (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss` followed by either `-##:##`, `.##Z` or `Z`) (optional)
  # @param limit integer The number of records to return.  The minimum supported value is 1 and maximum supported value is 500.  Note that `limit` is a \"best effort\" request since there may not be enough visit entries to satisfy the limit. (optional)
  # @param previous character Retrieve the previous page of content visit logs relative to the provided value.  This value corresponds to an internal reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate attribute within the paging object of a previous response. (optional)
  # @param var_next character Retrieve the next page of content visit logs relative to the provided value.  This value corresponds to an internal reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate attribute within the paging object of a previous response. (optional)
  # @param asc_order character Determines if the response records should be listed in ascending or descending order within the response.  Ordering is by the `started` timestamp field. (optional)
  # @return [object]

  # Get Shiny App Usage
  # This endpoint returns a portion of the Shiny application usage information, as well as paging details that can be used to navigate that information.  The information returned is based on data collected by Posit Connect as users visit Shiny applications.  Because of how visits are detected, end times will be slightly inflated by a reconnect timeout, generally around 15 seconds.  #### Important Notes  Prior to the release of this API, there was an issue with how visits were recorded that caused extra entries to be stored.  These will affect analyses that interpret visit counts or durations.  Entries that were recorded before the issue was addressed are not returned by default.  If you desire these records, specify the &#x60;min_data_version&#x60; filter with a value of 0.  - Because of how visits are detected, end times will be slightly inflated by the   currently configured client reconnect timeout, which defaults to 15 seconds.   The ending time may also be affected by connect and read timeout   settings.    The [Shiny Application   Events](../admin/historical-information/#shiny-application-events)   section of the Posit Connect Admin Guide has more details about   how these events are collected. - This endpoint requires administrator or publisher access.  #### Filtering of results:  There are several ways the result set can be filtered by the server before being sent back within the API response.
